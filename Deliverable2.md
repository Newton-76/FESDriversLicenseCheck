### Implementation

The Github environment and the foundation of the application has been organized
and implemented by Denis Neumann.
The setup of the application has been inspired by:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/
- https://web.dev/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQaL5YiSuqE (several videos of this series)

During the last weeks we worked on different parts.
Daniel implemented the NFC-Reader and met some technical issues in doing so.
Denis took care about the database, which is not yet able to be accessed via web browsers.
Eric transfered the different design patterns into HTML code.

### Test

The functionality of the application as a progressive web application has been
tested by Denis using Lighthouse by Google Chrome.

Further progresses have not been possible to be tested successfully.

### Status / grade of fulfillment of work products

- Requirements:95%
- Design/Documentation:70%
- Implementation: 50%
- Test:25%

### Lessons Learned

- Make sure to meet requirements before presenting the product
  => Driver's licenses are also equipped with a RFID-tag
- How to structure and organize the meeting with the customer
- Set to do's for scheduled meetings rather than making only general meetings, so there is a structured purpose to work towards.

- Requirements should be set up by more than 50% before starting the project
- The grade of fulfillment of the requirements shows how much of the requirements are understood, not implemented
