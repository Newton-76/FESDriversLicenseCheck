### PWA vs Native Application

\+ Multi Platform Compatibility  
\+ No Installation on Client System  
\+ No Update on Client System  
\+ Can be shared through URL rather than App Store  
\+ An Icon linking to the PWA can be created on the Device  
\+ Low Data Consumption  
\+ Offline Usability through Service Worker API  
\+ Fast Load Time  
\+ Advanced Application Features usable on Web Pages  
\+ Created and updated in a relatively short amount of time  

\- Uses more Battery Power  
\- RFID Functionality is only available on Chrome for Android as an Experimental Feature  
\- Limited Offline Functionality  
\- Limited access to Hardware Features  
\- Requires us learning about PWAs, Javascript and HTML rather than using our existing Java experience  
\- PWAs are relatively new, so there is less Information and Created Content available  

Decision:
We decided on creating a PWA as it is a new technology and we could use this project to gain in-depth
knowledge about it. The client also expressed a preference for something new over an Android application.

### Atom IDE

\+ Highly customizable  
\+ Native Integration of GitHub  
\+ Comes with integration for Node.js  
\+ Open Source  
\+ Offers Fuzzy Search and Linters  

\- Slightly harder to just download and start working with  
\- High Memory Usage  
\- High Battery Usage  
\- Low Performance especially with larger files  

Decision:
We decided on Atom as IDE because of its closeness to our main code sharing tool GitHub and and the ease of 
adding plugins, such as for previewing web pages directly in the IDE.
