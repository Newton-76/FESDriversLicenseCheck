## Deliverable 1  


### Denis (Requirements)  
  
Describes the problem to be solved, but the requirements to do so are  
not very detailed yet. The explanation for the working between user, application, scanner  
and database should be more in-depth.  

### Eric (Documentary and Sketches)  
  
Only shows one possible path through the application menu and lacks documentation   
so far. There is no testable implementation yet.


## Deliverable 2  

### Design

A barebone structure has been created for the UI, but it not yet uniform. A specific style  
and layout should be enforced throughout the entire application, implemented through CSS.  
Interactive elements  should be made with Javascript, so it is easier to apply functions.

### Database

Also a barebone database. The specific design needs to be finished based on the implementation  
of our code in the application. In the current form, it can not be run on a PWA, changes will be  
needed to be made based on how we deploy the final application.

## Deliverable 3  

### UI

The visible webpage needs to be cleaned up to only have the necessary functionality, active elements  
should be added so the user can see if the site is reactive or currently processing a request.

### Database

The database now runs on desktop but still needs to be made mobile friendly.

### NFC

Using NFC only works in secure environments, the server we used to test this functionality before did not   
support https, so we had to switch to githup pages for now.
