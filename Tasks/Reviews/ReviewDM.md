Reviews by Daniel Medovic:  
Requirements: Describes the problem to be solved, but the requirements to do so are  
not very detailed yet. The explanation for the working between user, application, scanner  
and database should be more in-depth.  
Prototype: Only shows one possible path through the application menu and lacks documentation   
so far.
