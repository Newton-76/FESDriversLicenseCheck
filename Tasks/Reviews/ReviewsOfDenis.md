## Deliverable 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Daniel (Design)

Took care of the design evaluation. In the first step he had an error in
formatting the plus and minus symbols in the .md file.
There are still a lot of spelling mistakes, especially considering the upper
and lower case spelling.

### Eric (Documentary and Sketches)

Has already done a little sketch of the program's user interface using adobe XD,
but didn't quite meet the requirements with it. Those errors have been corrected
in the meantime.

### Nawid (Sketches)

Unfortunately he left the group, but before he did so, he supported us with a
few sketches, that may be used in the future process of the project.

## Deliverable 2

### NFC-Reader

In the beginning of Phase 2 of our project, I tried to implement a NFC reader,
to scan the RFID tags. Unfortunately I realized very soon, that using the NFC
reader via a Progressive Web Application is not possible on an Apple device.
From that moment on I dealt with the database and Daniel took care of the NFC
reader.
Until now there is not much to review, because he could also not find a
fitting solution yet. (We want to consult with Mr. Liebehenschel and maybe also
with another group, that already got the reader working)

### Implementation of the Design

Eric presented his progress in implementing his design suggestions in the
application.
So far it looks a little bit unstructured, but Eric also said, that he is still
working with it and tries to figure out how HTML actually works.
Also i would rather recommend to implement the button functions in JavaScript
rather than in HTML.
Another suggestion would be to use the cascading style sheets to design the
on screen items.
