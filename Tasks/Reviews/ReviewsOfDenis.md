# Daniel (Design)

Took care of the design evaluation. In the first step he had an error in
formatting the plus and minus symbols in the .md file.
There are still a lot of spelling mistakes, especially considering the upper
and lower case spelling.

# Eric (Documentary and Sketches)

Has already done a little sketch of the program's user interface using adobe XD,
but didn't quite meet the requirements with it. Those errors have been corrected
in the meantime.

# Nawid (Sketches)

Unfortunately he left the group, but before he did so, he supported us with a
few sketches, that may be used in the future process of the project.
