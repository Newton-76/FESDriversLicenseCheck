# Daniel

Didn't contribute quite enough to get a review, but he has lots of good ideas
for the project and I'm sure he will deliver soon.

# Eric

Has already done a little sketch of the program's user interface using adobe XD,
but didn't quite meet the requirements with it. Those errors have been corrected
in the meantime.

# Nawid

Unfortunately he left the group, but before he did so, he supported us with a
few sketches, that may be used in the future process of the project.
