# Requirements (Denis)
Would be better if we done the requirement documentary like we learned it in SWE-Analysis, with a list of the small requirement parts. The Requirements here are more Use Cases then Reqirements. This comes after document the hard requirements.

# Design (Daniel)
Could do better by also shown pro and cons of the opposite. Maybe also a little bit longer explanation at the end why we finally decided this and not the other technology, by implement the important pros and cons.
