# Deliverable 1

## Requirements (Denis)
Would be better if we done the requirement documentary like we learned it in SWE-Analysis, with a list of the small requirement parts. The Requirements here are more Use Cases then Reqirements. This comes after document the hard requirements.

## Design (Daniel)
Could do better by also shown pro and cons of the opposite. Maybe also a little bit longer explanation at the end why we finally decided this and not the other technology, by implement the important pros and cons.

# Deliverable 2

## NFC Reading Function
At this point we are not able to use funtions for the reading of NFC Chips. We need to set up our own Interface for that kind of funtionalities. Therfore we need help from the other groups, that already can use that functions. Meanwhile we could work with placeholder functions. Everyone should make use of his branch on Git for working, so it would be easier to anaylze what could have been wrong in the group.

## Database
We need to find a solution for the problem that, our PWA does not work with the actual settings. It seems like the problem is something with the initial SQL Statements.
At the end we also need to find a solution for hosting the Database in the current architecture.
